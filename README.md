Super optimized Tic-Tac-Toe game written in c++

This implementation features O(1) move function and some cool optimizations. It would probably run really great on a microcontroller. Move time on a desktop CPU varies from 60 ~ 100 nanoseconds. Some variables are still 16 bit, like the bitboard, so pure 8bit is not here yet.
